// Arithmetic Operators

// Assignment Operators

assignment -= 5 // same as assignment = assignment - 5
console.log("a is now = ", a)
assignment *= 5 // same as assignment = assignment * 5
console.log("a is now = ", a)
assignment /= 5 // same as assignment = assignment / 5

// Comparison Operators 
let comp1 = 6;

console.log("comp1 != comp2 is ", comp1 != comp2)
console.log("comp1 === comp2 is ", comp1 === comp2)
console.log("comp1 !== comp2 is ", comp1 !== comp2)
console.log("comp1 > comp2 is ", comp1 > comp2)

// Logical Operators
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
console.log(x<y && x==5)
console.log(x>y || x==5)
console.log(!false)
console.log(!true)

// This is a single line comment
